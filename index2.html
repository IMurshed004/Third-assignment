        <p>The variables declared with var are accessible globally or within the function they were declared.
            Values of this kind of variable can be changed and updated later on globally or within the function.<br>
            The variables declared with let are accessible only within the block they are declared in like in the loop 
            or in the if-else statememt. Values of this kind of variable can be changed and updated later on just like var.<br>
            We cannot reassign values to variables declared with const. However, if the const variable holds an object or array,
            we can modify the object's properties or array elements.<br>
            We can only redeclare var but not let and const.

            Both find() and filter() are array methods used to search for elements in an array, but they differ in what they return.
            <br>
     find returns the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function.
     <br>
     filter returns a new array containing all elements that satisfy the provided testing function.
      no elements satisfy the condition, it returns an empty array.
        </p>

JavaScript has several methods to select elements in the Document Object Model (DOM):
<ul>
    <li>document.getElementById(id)</li>
    <li>document.getElementsByClassName(className)</li>
    <li>document.getElementsByTagName(tagName)</li>
    <li>document.querySelector(selector)</li>
    <li>document.querySelectorAll(selector)</li>
</ul>
   </p>
